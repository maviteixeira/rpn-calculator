A simple [RPN calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) 

First of all download the test dependencies with the command:

``$npm install``


In order to run the tests use the command below:

``$npm test``

To calculate you should pass a expression separating each number and operator using space, like the command below:

``$npm run "1 2 +"`` that would be equal 3

``$npm run "2 5 * 4 + 3 2 * 1 + /"`` that would be equal 2
